    <string name="intro_one_it">Hinton is a fake news generator (video) platform that aims to create
        awareness among the society about how fake new generation is
        possible and it aims to make people believe not to blindly follow
        what is seen on social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram.
        The main working of the project comes in form that we can alter
        facial expressions in a video live upto an extent that it is very
        difficult to distinguish between original and generated video.
        We use ResNet34 model trained to detect 68 points facial
        landmarks on the target video, pix2pix research paper for creating a
        GAN that has 2 neural networks I.e a discriminator and a generator
        both trained on Pytorch, Tensorflow and Keras separately for
        comparisons and then combined to make the final architecture of
        the pix2pix model

    <string name="intro_three_it">Automation and Real Time Monitoring are now becoming an integral part of every industrial
        setup. This project proposes an IOT (Internet of Things) based real-time monitoring and automation system
        for a prototype of an industrial setup. This system allows the operator/manager/owner of the plant to monitor
        and control the various industrial appliances of the plant remotely through an interactive web application.
        It also provides various security features, enhances the efficiency of the plant and stores the activities
        of the industrial setup in an extensive database. This project uses Arduino Uno that interfaces with the
        hardware components of the industrial setup and an IOT based Wi-Fi chip known as BOLT to connect the setup to
        the internet through the BOLT cloud. The web application is made totally responsive so as to access the system
        from any internet enabled device and in order to provide fast delivery of any emergency action.
        The major aim of this project is to demonstrate the effectiveness of an IOT based system in increasing the
        security, minimizing the power consumption, providing real time analysis and providing remote access to the

        physical system of the industrial setup using an alternate source of energy.

    <string name="intro_four_it">Market Basket Analysis is a modelling technique based upon the theory that if you buy a
        certain group of items, you are more (or less) likely to buy another group of items. Market Basket Analysis is one
        of the most common and useful types of data analysis for marketing and retailing. It checks the items that
        are frequently purchased by customers and offers are send to that customer related to that particular item
        that is frequently purchased through SMPT protocol. In this we are using AR(association Rule).
        AR (Association Rules) is a powerful technique that can search through very large sets of seemingly random
        data to identify various types of patterns.The purpose of market basket analysis is to determine what products
        customers purchase together.  It takes its name from the idea of customers throwing all their purchases into a
        shopping cart (a "market basket") during grocery shopping.

    <string name="module_two_it">
        1. site vs site: It allows you to analyse your business search engine competition to get the most on internet investment \n
        2. Pdf Report Generation: Download seo pdf to easy and reliable offline access to your search engine insights\n
        3. Share: You can share your seo scores on various social media platforms\n
        4. Keyword consistency: allows you to analyse your webpage as per their keyword concentration\n
        5. Usability testing: analyse user behaviour as per the search engine standards\n
        6. Compare Domains Individually: Get instant compare analysis when you are done analysing a single domain without heading back to site vs site page\n
        7. Broken Links Analysis: Broken links send users to non-existing web pages. They are bad for your site's usability, reputation and SEO.\n

    <string name="module_three_it">
        1.	Motor Module: This module comprises of four motors along with four LEDs which indicate their ON/OFF status .One pair of motors is temperature-dependent while the other is time- dependent. The working of temperature dependent motors alternates on the basis of increasing temperatures measured using temperature sensors. While the load share of time dependent motors alternates between the main and auxiliary motor with time.\n
        2.	Lighting Module: The second module comprises of three LDRs (Light Dependent Resistors: whose functioning depends on the incident light intensity) and eight LEDs. The LEDs adjust their brightness based on the intensity of the natural light coming from the window that is sensed by the LDRs so that the plant is always well lit and thus providing an increased efficiency.\n
        3.	Secure Room Module: This module constitutes of a proximity sensor, servo motor, and a fingerprint sensor lock mechanism. The primary function of the module revolves around automatic door opening mechanism using the above mentioned devices. The proximity sensor helps to judge the presence of a person near the door while the fingerprint sensor uses the fingerprint pattern which is unique, to detect whether the person is authenticated to enter the premises of the secure room or not.\n
        4.	Smoke Sensing Module and Website: There is also a smoke sensor which senses smoke in case of a fire and alerts the industry staff through piezoelectric buzzer and sending an SMS and a notification in the UI as well. The various modules of the project are interconnected via the BOLT cloud to a Web Application accessible only via OTP protected login page. A fully functional admin control panel gives the admin functionality of shifting from an automatic mode to manual mode and control each hardware part separately.\n
