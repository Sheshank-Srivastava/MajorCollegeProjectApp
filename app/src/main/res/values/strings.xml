    <string name="intro_three_it">Automation and Real Time Monitoring are now becoming an integral part of every industrial
        setup. This project proposes an IOT (Internet of Things) based real-time monitoring and automation system
        for a prototype of an industrial setup. This system allows the operator/manager/owner of the plant to monitor
        and control the various industrial appliances of the plant remotely through an interactive web application.
        It also provides various security features, enhances the efficiency of the plant and stores the activities
        of the industrial setup in an extensive database. This project uses Arduino Uno that interfaces with the
        hardware components of the industrial setup and an IOT based Wi-Fi chip known as BOLT to connect the setup to
        the internet through the BOLT cloud. The web application is made totally responsive so as to access the system
        from any internet enabled device and in order to provide fast delivery of any emergency action.
        The major aim of this project is to demonstrate the effectiveness of an IOT based system in increasing the
        security, minimizing the power consumption, providing real time analysis and providing remote access to the

        physical system of the industrial setup using an alternate source of energy.

    <string name="intro_four_it">Market Basket Analysis is a modelling technique based upon the theory that if you buy a
        certain group of items, you are more (or less) likely to buy another group of items. Market Basket Analysis is one
        of the most common and useful types of data analysis for marketing and retailing. It checks the items that
        are frequently purchased by customers and offers are send to that customer related to that particular item
        that is frequently purchased through SMPT protocol. In this we are using AR(association Rule).
        AR (Association Rules) is a powerful technique that can search through very large sets of seemingly random
        data to identify various types of patterns.The purpose of market basket analysis is to determine what products
        customers purchase together.  It takes its name from the idea of customers throwing all their purchases into a
        shopping cart (a "market basket") during grocery shopping.

With Project Lambee, we make use of the cheapest interaction tool available to mankind, hands. Making use of advanced Computer Vision Techniques and integrating them with Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques we can extract meaning out of the normal hand gestures and patterns. Normal hand waves, for example, indicate navigation to either of the directions. Up, down, left, right navigation can be achieved by respective gestures by the index finger, download on the other hand can be achieved by the action of clinching of a fist, zooming via pinch etc.

        In today’s era of technology, where machines are being extensively used in all the fields we
        are trying to emulate concept, which will be of great use in public transport systems.
        In order to decrease this traffic, we decided to work on the construction of a project which
        reduces the manual work and hence increases the vehicle speed passing by the toll booth This
        will increase the speed of the passing by vehicles allowing them to pass through the booth
        without stopping and also will reduce the manual work and as a result reducing the traffic
        gathering at the toll collecting booths. In our project, we have a vehicle equipped with the
        application (user), an admin maintaing all the necessary details and a system at the toll station.
        Whenever the vehicle enters into the coverage area of toll, it scans the car number using OCR,
        and maps all the details stored in the database relating to that particular vehicle.
        The in charge at the toll station realises  whether  the toll is payed earlier through the virtual wallet ,
        and if not, it can pay the toll at that instant instead.
        If the toll is already paid , the vehicle can automatically pass and doesn’t need to stop at the gate.
        Therefore, it reduces the traffic by reducing the turnaround  time of every user.

        One of the main concerns with our environment has been solid waste management which
        involves the detection, monitoring and management of wastes. We have proposed a method
        of smart garbage monitoring in which waste management is automated by using ‘Internet of
        Things(IOT)’. It was observed that the garbage truck used to go around the town to collect
        solid waste twice a day. Although this system was thorough, it was very inefficient. For
        example, let say street A is a busy street and we see that the garbage fills up really fast
        whereas maybe street B even after two days the bin is not even half full. So, our goal was to
        optimise the routes taken by the trash collectors so as to plan their daily/weekly pick up
        schedule which in turn would increase fuel efficiency.The system monitors the garbage bins
        and informs about the level of garbage collected in the garbage bins via an android app at
        any time. Using that data we can then optimize waste collection routes and ultimately reduce
        fuel consumption.The highly filled garbage bins will be covered first followed by the others
        depending on the amount of garbage in the bin.

        The volume, variety, and velocity of data being produced in all areas of the retail industry is growing exponentially, creating both challenges and opportunities for those diligently analyzing this data to gain a competitive advantage. Although retailers have been using data analytics to generate business intelligence for years, the extreme composition of today’s data necessitates new approaches and tools. This is because the retail industry has entered the big data era, having access to more information that can be used to create amazing shopping experiences and forge tighter connections between customers, brands, and retailers. A trail of data follows products as they are manufactured, shipped, stocked, advertised, purchased, consumed, and talked about by consumers – all of which can help forward-thinking retailers increase sales and operations performance. This requires an end-to-end retail analytics solution capable of analyzing large datasets populated by retail systems and sensors, enterprise resource planning (ERP), inventory control, social media, and other sources Hadoop is an open-source framework that allows to store and process big data in a distributed environment across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage. Due to the advent of new technologies, devices, and communication means like social networking sites, the amount of data produced by mankind is growing rapidly every year. The amount of data produced by us from the beginning of time till 2003 was 5 billion gigabytes. If you pile up the data in the form of disks it may fill an entire football field. The same amount was created in every two days in 2011, and in every ten minutes in 2013. This rate is still growing enormously. Though all this information produced is meaningful and can be useful when processed, it is being neglected.

        This project gives us the opportunity for the development of a microcontroller based system for wireless heartbeat and temperature monitoring using Wi-Fi module along with a smart medicine box system. By this we can easily provide real time information available for many users and can send them alert in critical conditions over internet. In India, many patients are dying because of heart attacks along with several other causes and the reason behind this factor is that they are not getting proper help during the after-operation and treatment period. To give them timely and proper help first we want continuous monitoring of patient health. The fixed monitoring system can be used only when the patient is lying on bed and these systems are huge and only available in the hospitals in ICU. The system is developed for home use by patients that are not in a critical condition but need to be timely monitored by doctor or family. In any critical condition the SMS is sent to the doctor or any family member. So that we can easily save many lives by providing them quick service. With the development of world, Health monitoring system is used every field such as hospital, home care unit, sports, etc. This Patient Monitoring System could be used for patients with chronicle diseases who have daily check-up regime. There are various instruments available in market to keep track on internal body changes but there are many limits in maintenance part due to their heavy cost, size of instruments and mobility of patients.

        This project deals with the problem incurred in fields due to manual farming methods. It promises a remote access and real time monitoring. In this we have connected sensors to check the exact moisture condition of soil and weather accordingly irrigate the crops. The android app gives farmer the access to the system even while sitting remotely and control the system, he can turn it on/off anytime just by a click on his phone. A WiFi module is used to link the analog signals to digital data. The sensed data is then mapped to a website that stores and retrieves data on cloud called thingspeak where he can view the status of the soil, plants etc graphically. This helps him understand the crop requirements and improve the yield. Parameters like soil moisture that cant manually be checked can be sensed instantly thereby reducing the farmer’s effort. He is also given a manual control over the system. Database SQLite is used for logging in and storing the credentials. This helps the farmer to secure this system from any 3rd party intervention.

                Steganography is the hiding of a secret message within an ordinary message and the extraction of it at its destination. Steganography takes cryptography a step farther by hiding an encrypted message so that no one suspects it exists. Ideally, anyone scanning your data will fail to know it contains encrypted data\n
        	The aim is to communicate a text among a transmitter and receiver, such that a third party (Intruder/Hacker) cannot understand the message.\n
        	Aim of stenography is to avoid decryption through an opponent who does not distinguish the secret key generate.\n
        	Design new algorithm Sequential-DNA, Round-LSB to calculate the accuracy of method.\n

        In computer science, secure transmission refers to the transfer of data such as confidential or proprietary information over a secure channel. Many secure transmission methods require a type of encryption. Some organizations transmit data between applications, such as an electronic health record. It is wise to view such transmissions, if the data travels outside an organization, as any message sent over the Internet, meaning its subject to interception and misuse unless protected properly. The data transmitted over the internet is in the form of images and in order to protect the secure data like bank details which are generally shared through the form of images image processing is to be studied in detail along with other audio formats which may also act as a way of transmission that is why our project is aimed at implementing image, text processing in terms of cryptography and steganography via the use of a java application

    <string name="intro_twentyone_it">Word2vec is a method of computing vector representations of words introduced by a team of researchers at Google led by Tomas Mikolov.
The word2vec model, has led to significant improvements to natural language processing (NLP) task performance.
This paper outlines an approach to improving upon the word2vec skip-gram
model. In order to obtain better word representations for morphologically rich languages and to yield more accurate results for rare or unseen words. A word representation is derived from the vector embeddings of its constituent ngrams, which are updated and learned in the training process.
The recently introduced continuous Skip-gram model is an efficient method for learning high-quality distributed vector representations that capture a large number of precise syntactic and semantic word relationships. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We train two models on different corpus: one with unigram embeddings, and another with bi-gram embeddings. We evaluate the models using word similarity and word analogy tasks and comparing to a word2vec skip-gram baseline.

    Motion detection is the process of detecting a change in the position of an object relative to its surroundings or a change in the surroundings relative to an object. Motion detection can be achieved by either mechanical or electronic method. A typical motion detection system can be divided into front-end system and back-end system. The task of the front-end system is to recognize motion by web-camera and represents it by a set of rectangles (red and blue).Features like Movement detection and Luminescence density. The feature is extracted using Kalman Algorithm. The task of the back-end system is to create a model to recognize the motion from the image in recognition phase.

        Module 2.\n The Arduino IDE is then installed , along with the NodeMCU libraries through boards
        manager which recognize and help coding arduino sketches compatible to the NodeMCU
        board.\n
        Module 3.\n Now, we test the board for internet connectivity by connecting it with a wifi router/hotspot.
        This is achieved by coding in the SSID and Password and using the ESP8266 WiFi libraries
        compatible with arduino IDE.\n
        Module 4.\n Once the sketch is verified and compiled, we upload it by selecting the available COM
        port. Once it is flashed, the Serial Monitor (which would display the IP Address as output) is
        used to check whether the Node MCU is connected to the available WiFi network.\n
        Module 5.\n Further we interface the ultrasonic sensor with the NodeMCU development board to
        calculate the distance of an object in front of it. We use the principle of speed of sound in air
        and the time period to calculate distance of the object in front of the sensor.\n
        Module 6.\n First, the height of the dustbin is calculated which would eventually help to generate the
        percentage of the trash in the can as it fills up.\n
        Module 7.\n As the ultrasonic sensor measures the distance of the trash and hence the percentage of
        the can filled, it sends this data to the microcontroller. The microcontroller in return, is
        connected to the blynk cloud servers which sends the data on the mobile application.\n
        Module 8.\n As the trash in the bin reaches a certain amount, the application notifies the collector
        about the increasing level. (In this case, the threshold is kept at 75% of the amount of the
        dustbin which can be altered according to the preferences of the user.)\n
        Module 9.\n The application displays a series of three virtual LEDs that indicate the urgency of the
        action required for a particular can in the form of red, yellow and green lights.\n

        B)	Crawl Module: This module comprises of two parts, firstly it checks the value in $url, if it is empty, then it throws and exception “URL must be set” and after the URL is set it, it runs the crawl function. It fetches the pre-requisite depth and URL from the $depth and $url variables. After the execution of crawl function, it arranges the fetched URLs alphabetically. And stores it into the $results array.\n
        C)	_crawl Module: This module constructs an array named $seen, checks if the there is no value in $url, and if it’s so, it fetches the url from the buildurl function. It then checks for the value if depth and url again. After both the values are fetched, they are stored in the $results array.\n
        D)	Dom Module: This module constructs a Document Object Model from the fetched url. The url(s) and depth(s) of the fetched urls are stored in the $results array. Then the above constructed $seen array is stored in newly constructed $crawled array. This is done for the comparison of urls later.\n
        E)	Anchor Module: This module fetches all the urls from the DOM by identifying the anchor tag. All these anchors are now stored in $elements. It then checks for the href tags, if not found, is fetched from the $elements and stored in the $seen array.\n
        F)	Array_diff: This module compares the urls stored in $seen array and $crawled array. If the crawled url matches the urls in seen array, the crawler skips it to prevent ambiguity.\n
        G)	Buildurl Module: This module helps build a proper url by looking for and removing any “#” values and “javascripts” in the fetched urls. It also trims the required urls and stores then into the $parts array. The $parts data is then parsed using the value of $url and fetching the href it stores the complete path in $path.\n
        H)	BuildUrlFromParts Module: This module fetches all the values from the $parts array, the href, the host name, the port etc and builds a url to be stored in the $new_href.\n

            Module 2.\n DHT sensors-
            The DHT sensors are made of two parts, a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor. There is also a very basic chip inside that does some Analog to Digital conversion and spits out a digital signal with the humidity. This digital signal is fairly easy to read using any microcontroller.\n

            Module 3.\n Temperature Sensor-
             We are using Lm35 Temperature. The LM35 series are precision integrated circuit LM35 temperature sensors, whose output voltage is linearly proportional to the temperature in Celsius (Centigrade). It measures the temperature of patient and sent that Analog readings to microcontroller.\n

            Module 4.\n Heart Beat Sensor-
            Heart beat sensor is designed to give digital output of heart beat when a finger is placed inside it. This digital output can be connected to Arduino directly to measure the Beats per Minute (BPM) rate. It works on the principle of light modulation by blood flow through finger each pulse. IC LM358 is used for this sensor.\n



            Module 5.\n Wi-Fi-
            Wi-Fi is must in this project as  it helps in connectivity of health monitoring system to others like to the emergency contacts and regular updates to doctor and it is also used in sending data.\n

    <string name="module_twentytwo_it">We monitor data access in the cloud and detect abnormal data access patterns User profiling is a
well known Technique that can be applied here to model how, when, and how much a user
accesses their information in the Cloud. Such ‘normal user’ behavior can be continuously
checked to determine whether abnormal access to a user’s information is occurring. This method
of behavior-based security is commonly used in fraud detection applications. Such profiles
would naturally include volumetric information, how many documents are typically read and
how often. We monitor for abnormal search behaviors that exhibit deviations from the user
baseline the correlation of search behavior anomaly detection with trap-based decoy files should
provide stronger evidence of malfeasance, and therefore improve a detector’s accuracy.
Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on demand network access to a shared pool
of configurable computing resources (for example, networks, servers, storage, applications, and
services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or
service-provider interaction. We propose a different approach for securing data in the cloud
using offensive decoy technology. We monitor data access in the cloud and detect abnormal data
access patterns. We launch a disinformation attack by returning large amounts of decoy
information to the attacker. This protects against the misuse of the user’s real data. We use this
technology to launch disinformation attacks against malicious insiders, preventing them from
distinguishing the real sensitive customer data from fake worthless data the decoys, then, serve
two purposes:\n
(1) Validating whether data access is authorized when abnormal information access is detected.\n
(2) Confusing the attacker with bogus information.</string>

        Module  1.\n Arduino and  Arduino IDE: The Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328 (datasheet). It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz ceramic resonator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.Arduino consists of both a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a microcontroller) and a piece of software, or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on your computer, used to write and upload computer code to the physical board.\n
        Module  2.\n Relay board:  A relay is an electrical device which is generally used to control high voltages using very low voltage as an Input. This consists of a coil wrapped around a pole and a two small metal flaps(nodes) that are used to close the circuit. One of the node is fixed and other is movable. Whenever an electricity is passed through the coil, it creates a magnetic field and attracts the moving node towards the static node and the circuit gets completed. So, just by applying small voltage to power up the coil we can actually complete the circuit for the high voltage to travel.\n
        Module 3.\n Visual Studio for C# : Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. It is used to develop computer programs, as well as web sites, web apps, web services and mobile apps.  Visual Studio includes a code editor supporting IntelliSense (the code completion component) as well as code refactoring. The integrated debugger works both as a source-level debugger and a machine-level debugger. Other built-in tools include a code profiler, forms designer for building GUI applications, web designer, class designer, and database schema designer. It accepts plug-ins that enhance the functionality at almost every level.Visual studio is used to run the C# software for Speech Recognition. Speech recognition is the inter-disciplinary sub-field of computational linguistics that develops methodologies and technologies that enables the recognition and translation of spoken language into text by computers. It is also known as "automatic speech recognition" (ASR), "computer speech recognition", or just "speech to text" (STT).  Some speech recognition systems require "training" (also called "enrollment") where an individual speaker reads text or isolated vocabulary into the system. The system analyzes the person's specific voice and uses it to fine-tune the recognition of that person's speech, resulting in increased accuracy.\n
