    <string name="intro_one_it">Hinton is a fake news generator (video) platform that aims to create
        awareness among the society about how fake new generation is
        possible and it aims to make people believe not to blindly follow
        what is seen on social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram.
        The main working of the project comes in form that we can alter
        facial expressions in a video live upto an extent that it is very
        difficult to distinguish between original and generated video.
        We use ResNet34 model trained to detect 68 points facial
        landmarks on the target video, pix2pix research paper for creating a
        GAN that has 2 neural networks I.e a discriminator and a generator
        both trained on Pytorch, Tensorflow and Keras separately for
        comparisons and then combined to make the final architecture of
        the pix2pix model

    <string name="intro_three_it">Automation and Real Time Monitoring are now becoming an integral part of every industrial
        setup. This project proposes an IOT (Internet of Things) based real-time monitoring and automation system
        for a prototype of an industrial setup. This system allows the operator/manager/owner of the plant to monitor
        and control the various industrial appliances of the plant remotely through an interactive web application.
        It also provides various security features, enhances the efficiency of the plant and stores the activities
        of the industrial setup in an extensive database. This project uses Arduino Uno that interfaces with the
        hardware components of the industrial setup and an IOT based Wi-Fi chip known as BOLT to connect the setup to
        the internet through the BOLT cloud. The web application is made totally responsive so as to access the system
        from any internet enabled device and in order to provide fast delivery of any emergency action.
        The major aim of this project is to demonstrate the effectiveness of an IOT based system in increasing the
        security, minimizing the power consumption, providing real time analysis and providing remote access to the
        physical system of the industrial setup using an alternate source of energy.

    <string name="intro_four_it">Market Basket Analysis is a modelling technique based upon the theory that if you buy a
        certain group of items, you are more (or less) likely to buy another group of items. Market Basket Analysis is one
        of the most common and useful types of data analysis for marketing and retailing. It checks the items that
        are frequently purchased by customers and offers are send to that customer related to that particular item
        that is frequently purchased through SMPT protocol. In this we are using AR(association Rule).
        AR (Association Rules) is a powerful technique that can search through very large sets of seemingly random
        data to identify various types of patterns.The purpose of market basket analysis is to determine what products
        customers purchase together.  It takes its name from the idea of customers throwing all their purchases into a
        shopping cart (a "market basket") during grocery shopping.
